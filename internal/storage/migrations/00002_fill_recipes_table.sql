The Tom Collins is served in, you guessed it, a Collins glass, which is narrower than a typical highball. A nice side effect of this glassware is that when you tilt the drink all the way back to get those last few drops, the ice is a lot less likely to spill down the front of your shirt. But hey, come July, that might not be so bad!The origins of the Tom Collins recipe is a bit murky, but it seems likely that it was invented in England sometime in the early 19th century. That said, the Tom Collins cocktail first appeared in print in the 1876 edition of American barman Jerry Thomas'' How to Mix Drinks.For a quick changeup, use vodka in place of gin, and you get the easygoing Vodka Collins.','{"2 oz gin","1 oz lemon juice","0.25 oz simple syrup","Club soda","Maraschino cherry and lemon slice for garnish"}','{"Add the gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup to a Collins glass filled with ice.",Stir.,"Fill the rest of the class with club soda.","Garnish with a cherry and lemon slice and serve."}'),

It''s most notable for being served in a signature Hurricane glass, but if you don''t have one lying around you can easily use a&nbsp;Highball glass&nbsp;instead.What''s in a&nbsp;Hurricane Cocktail?The&nbsp;Hurricane Cocktail&nbsp;is fresh, citrusy, and always at home on the beach or at any summer festivities.The&nbsp;original Hurricane&nbsp;recipe&nbsp;is a simple cocktail with only a few&nbsp;ingredients. As it often goes with bartenders, however, it has been riffed on and experimented with over the years—especially during the rise of Tiki bars and tropical drink culture.Our&nbsp;Hurricane recipe&nbsp;below features&nbsp;light rum,&nbsp;dark rum,&nbsp;lime juice, orange juice, passion fruit juice,&nbsp;simple syrup, and&nbsp;grenadine, with an&nbsp;orange slice&nbsp;or wedge for the&nbsp;garnish. Sometimes, a&nbsp;maraschino cherry&nbsp;or a lime is used as an alternative&nbsp;garnish.Who invented the&nbsp;Hurricane Cocktail?While the origin isn''t certain, the&nbsp;Hurricane Cocktail&nbsp;is widely believed to have been invented in the&nbsp;1940s&nbsp;in post-war&nbsp;New Orleans. It''s usually credited to bar owner&nbsp;Pat O''Brien.The Hurricane was always intended to be a&nbsp;rum cocktail, as after&nbsp;World War&nbsp;II many spirits including&nbsp;whiskey,&nbsp;gin, and brandy were in short supply but rum was plentiful.&nbsp;O''Brien&nbsp;reportedly came up with the&nbsp;recipe&nbsp;when he wanted to get rid of a surplus of&nbsp;rum&nbsp;he had lying around his namesake bar, Pat O''Briens.He ended up serving the drink in a&nbsp;hurricane lamp-shaped glass as a marketing ploy (this glass is known today as the eponymous&nbsp;Hurricane glass) and it has been a tropical favorite ever since.If you have a large group of people to serve, you can easily turn the Hurricane into a punch—simply multiply the&nbsp;recipe&nbsp;below by the number of servings you need.How to make a&nbsp;Hurricane Cocktail?Making a Hurricane is not hard, but it does require you have a&nbsp;cocktail shaker and plenty of ice. Start by shaking all&nbsp;ingredients&nbsp;except the&nbsp;garnish&nbsp;together with ice. Then&nbsp;strain&nbsp;everything into a&nbsp;large Hurricane glass&nbsp;over&nbsp;fresh ice, garnish, and serve with a&nbsp;straw.Follow the&nbsp;recipe&nbsp;and instructions below to make a delicious&nbsp;Hurricane cocktail.','{"2 oz white rum","2 oz dark rum","1 oz fresh lime juice","1 oz fresh orange juice","2 oz passion fruit juice","0.5 oz simple syrup","0.5 oz grenadine","Orange wedge, lime wedge, and/or maraschino cherry for garnish"}','{"Add all ingredients (except garnishes) to a cocktail shaker with ice and shake until chilled.","Strain into a Hurricane glass over fresh ice.","Garnish as desired and serve."}'),

The recipe for the Singapore Sling changed drastically over time, due to being codified on handwritten notes, getting lost in translation as it traveled the globe, and the gradual decline in availability of some of its ingredients, like Cherry Heering and Bénédictine. Today, though, it''s possible to make a Singapore Sling that''s pretty close to the original, which is the recipe provided below. It doesn''t traditionally have a garnish of any kind, but you can use a lime twist (added later at the Raffles Hotel) or a maraschino cherry if you''re so inclined.','{"1 oz gin","1 oz Cherry Heering","1 oz Bénédictine","1 oz fresh lime juice","1 dash Angostura bitters","2 oz soda water","Lime twist or cherry for garnish (optional)"}','{"Add all ingredients except soda to a Highball or Collins glass over ice and stir gently.","Top with soda, stir once, and serve.","Optionally, garnish with a twist of lime or a cherry."}'),

This is a classic Piña Colada recipe that doesn''t use any kind of pre-made mix, instead opting for coconut cream and fresh pineapple juice. Be sure to use a proper coconut cream, as the alternative, coconut milk, is usually too thin. However, it will do in a pinch, and you can add a bit of condensed milk if you want to thicken it up a bit.While most recipes call for white rum, a gold or dark rum can make things a little more interesting—just don''t bother using anything expensive, as its subtleties will be lost in the rest of the ingredients. This Piña Colada is blended, but you can also make a shaken version. Simply add all the ingredients to a cocktail shaker with ice, shake until chilled, and strain into a Hurricane glass with fresh ice.','{"2.5 oz rum","1.5 oz coconut cream","3 oz fresh pineapple juice"}','{"Put all ingredients into an electric blender with 2 cups of crushed ice.","Blend at a high speed for a short length of time.","Strain into a Hurricane glass (or Collins glass) and serve with a straw."}'),

All you''ll need is some white rum, brandy, orgeat syrup, orange juice, lemon juice, ice, and a blender to mix it all up. To garnish the Scorpion cocktail, you can use a slice or two of any citrus you''d like (orange or lemon are typical), a couple of good maraschino cherries, and a sprig of mint (clapped between your hands to release the essential oils) to really round out the aromas.This Scorpion recipe makes one serving, but it can easily be multiplied to serve in the classic Scorpion Bowl, which is a favorite at tiki bars around the world. The Scorpion Bowl typically has a smaller bowl in the center, into which you can pour some overproof rum and light it on fire for an extra-exotic presentation.','{"2 oz light rum","1 oz brandy","0.5 oz orgeat syrup","2 oz fresh-squeezed orange juice","1.5 oz fresh-squeezed lemon juice","Orange slice, maraschino cherries, and mint sprig for garnish"}','{"Add all ingredients to a blender with ice and blend for about 10 seconds.","Pour into a wine glass, Hurricane glass, tiki mug, or highball glass.","Garnish with orange wedge, maraschino cherries, and a sprig of clapped mint and serve."}'),

It can be made many different ways with either vodka or gin, but this recipe is a classic version that uses a bit more dry vermouth than many modern recipes (like the Dry Martini). James Bond, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Ernest Hemingway, and other fictional and historical greats have been known to enjoy the martini, and it has been associated with high society and good living for over a century.','{"2 oz gin","0.5 oz dry vermouth","Olive or lemon twist for garnish"}','{"Add the gin and vermouth to a mixing glass with ice, and stir until very cold","Strain into a chilled Martini glass.","Garnish with an olive or a lemon twist."}'),

Largely unknown in the U.S., though renowned throughout the bars in Jalisco, this traditional drink is produced by fermenting the heart of a mature agave plant in a cask, a method that has remained the same for thousands of years. The ancient libation is opaque and milky in color, with a subtly tart flavor. It can be enjoyed plain or mixed into cocktails.To bring pulque to its guests, Brooklyn bar Tiny’s Cantina has imported a selection of Pulque la Flora Pura. Bartender Aushim Raswant featured the pulque in original drinks, like the Néctar de Dioses (nectar of the gods) that you see here. The sweet and spicy cocktail was inspired by the flavors of Mexico and features a mix of pulque, mezcal, Oaxacan rum, chile liqueur, and agave syrup.','{"1 barspoon Paranubes White Rum","1 lemon rind","1 ounce pulque","1 ounce mezcal","0.5 ounce Ancho Reyes Verde","0.25 ounce agave syrup","Garnish: pineapple frond"}','{"Muddle the lemon rind with a barspoon of Paranubes White Rum in a shaker.

James Beard, the well-known American culinary icon, considered the Old-Fashioned one of the best of cocktails.Classic Old-Fashioned Cocktail RecipeCocktail aficionados have long argued about the "proper" recipe for an Old-Fashioned. Sugar cube or simple syrup? Orange twist or muddled fruit? A large cube of ice or something else? At Bevvy, our preferred Old-Fashioned calls for the simpler formula of the "classic recipe"—consisting of whiskey, sugar, and bitters over a large cubed ice—there''ll be no muddled fruit or bright cherries. That being said, the recipe below is very close to what people would have been drinking back when it was first invented in the 1800s.This Old-Fashioned recipes call for building your drink in the glass, but an alternate method involves stirring the ingredients with ice in a mixing glass before straining them into the serving glass.Who invented the Old-Fashioned cocktail?Among those that have laid claim to inventing the Old-Fashioned, the Pendennis Club in Louisville, Kentucky may be the best known and has been credited to have created the drink—but this claim has been debunked. Many other attempted claims have also been debunked, some due to strange recipes, others to date and timeline inconsistencies.The first known recipe for the Old-Fashioned is from a Chicago bartender named Theodore Proulx, in his book The Bartender''s Manual, but even still a connection has never been made that Chicago was the Old-Fashioned''s birthplace, nor Proulx the creator.So who did invent the Old-Fashioned? We may never know for sure. As Robert Simonson said in his book The Old-Fashioned: The Story of the World''s First Classic Cocktail, with Recipes and Lore: "[The history of] the Old-Fashioned is a much more complicated case. Being an outgrowth of the Whiskey Cocktail, it evolved more than it arrived. Claiming that one bartender created it is a bit like saying a single person invented jazz."','{"2 oz bourbon or rye whiskey","2 dashes Angostura bitters","1 sugar cube or 0.25 oz simple syrup","Orange twist for garnish"}','{"Add sugar cube, Angostura bitters, and optionally a few drops of warm water to the bottom of an Old-Fashioned glass and muddle until the sugar is dissolved (alternatively, just add simple syrup and bitters).","Add the whiskey.","Add one large ice cube and stir gently.","Garnish with an orange twist and serve."}'),
